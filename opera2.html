<P>Five years have flown since I took wing—
Time flies, and his footstep ne'er retards—
I'm the eldest daughter of your King.</p><br>
<h5><div class="TRP">TRP.</div></h5>
<P>we are her escort—First Life Guards!On the royal yacht,When the waves were white,
In a helmet hot And a tunic tight,And our great big boots,We defied the storm; For we're not recruits,
And his uniform A well drilled trooper ne'er discards—And we are her escort—First Life Guards!</p>
<h5><div class="ZAR">ZAR.</div></h5>          
<p> gentlemen I present to you,The pride and boast of their barrack-yards;They've taken, O! such care of me!</p><br>
<h5><div class="TRP">TRP.</div></h5> 
<p>For we are her escort—First Life Guards! When the tempest rose,And the ship went so—Do you supposeWe were ill? No, no!
Though a qualmish lot In a tunic tight,And a helmet hot And a breastplate bright.</p>
<d>(Which a well-drilled trooper ne'er discards)</d>
<h5><div class="CHORUS">CHORUS.</div></h5><br>
Knightsbridge nursemaids—serving fairies—<br>
Stars of proud Belgravian airies;<br>
At stern duty's call you leave them,<br>
Though you know how that must grieve them!<br>
