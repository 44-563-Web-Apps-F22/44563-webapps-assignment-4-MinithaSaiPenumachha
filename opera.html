        <h3>ACT I A Utopian Palm Grove</h3>
        <p>
            Zara:          Five years have flown since I took wing—
                      Time flies, and his footstep ne'er retards—
                 I'm the eldest daughter of your King.<br>

  Troop:         And we are her escort—First Life Guards!
                 On the royal yacht,
                      When the waves were white,
                 In a helmet hot
                      And a tunic tight,
                 And our great big boots,
                      We defied the storm;
                 For we're not recruits,
                      And his uniform
                 A well drilled trooper ne'er discards—
                 And we are her escort—First Life Guards!<br>

  Zara:          These gentlemen I present to you,
                      The pride and boast of their barrack-yards;
                 They've taken, O! such care of me!<br>

  Troop:         For we are her escort—First Life Guards!
                 When the tempest rose,
                      And the ship went so—
                 Do you suppose
                      We were ill? No, no!
                 Though a qualmish lot
                      In a tunic tight,
                 And a helmet hot,
                      And a breastplate bright
                 (Which a well-drilled trooper ne'er discards),
                 We stood as her escort—First Life Guards!<br>

                               CHORUS<br>

            Knightsbridge nursemaids—serving fairies—<br>
            Stars of proud Belgravian airies;<br>
            At stern duty's call you leave them,<br>
            Though you know how that must grieve them!<br>

  Zara:     Tantantarara-rara-rara!<br>

  Fitz:     Trumpet-call of Princess Zara!<br>

  Cho:      That's trump-call, and they're all trump cards—
            They are her escort—First Life Guards!<br>

                              ENSEMBLE<br>

              Chorus                     Princess Zara and Fitzbattleaxe<br>

              Ladies                     Oh! the hours are gold,<br>
                                         And the joys untold,
  Knightsbridge nursemaids, etc.         When my eyes behold<br>
                                              My beloved Princess;<br>
              Men                        And the years will seem<br>
  When the tempest rose, etc.            But a brief day-dream,<br>
                                         In the joy extreme<br>
                                              Of our happiness!<br>

  Full Chorus:  Knightsbridge nursemaids, serving fairies, etc.<br>

  (Enter King, Princess Nekaya and Kalyba, and Lady Sophy. As the
  King enters, the escort present arms.)<br>

  King:     Zara!  my beloved daughter!  Why, how well you look and
  how lovely you have grown!  (embraces her.)<br>

  Zara:     My dear father!  (embracing him)  And my two beautiful
            little sisters!  (embracing them)<br>

  Nekaya:   Not beautiful.<br>

  Kalyba:   Nice-looking.<br>

  Zara:     But first let me present to you the English warrior who
            commands my escort, and who has taken, O! such care of me
            during my voyage—Captain Fitzbattleaxe!<br>

  Troopers:      The First Life Guards.
                 When the tempest rose,
                 And the ship went so—

  (Captain Fitzbattleaxe motions them to be silent.  The Troopers
  place themselves in the four corners of the stage, standing at
  ease, immovably, as if on sentry.  Each is surrounded by an
  admiring group of young ladies, of whom they take no notice.)<br>

  King:     (to Capt. Fitz.)  Sir, you come from a country where
  every virtue flourishes.  We trust that you will not criticize too
  severely such shortcomings as you may detect in our semi-barbarous
  society.<br>

  Fitz.:    (looking at Zara)  Sir, I have eyes for nothing but the
  blameless and the beautiful.<br>

  King:     We thank you—he is really very polite!  (Lady
  Sophy, who has been greatly scandalized by the attentions paid to
  the Lifeguardsmen by the young ladies, marches the Princesses
  Nekaya and Kalyba towards an exit.)  Lady Sophy, do not leave us.<br>
